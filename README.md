# AHNS Eval: Measuring Image Generation Models on Aesthetic Harmony and Novelty.

## Abstract

This study evaluates the aesthetic quality and novelty of images generated by X.AI's Grok model using the Aesthetic Harmony and Novelty Score (AHNS) framework. Our analysis reveals moderate aesthetic quality (AHNS: 0.648 ± 0.112) and high novelty (0.960 ± 0.031), indicating the model's potential for creative outputs.

## Introduction

Generative models have revolutionized image creation, but evaluating their aesthetic quality remains challenging. This research introduces the AHNS framework to assess both harmony and novelty in generated images, with a focus on X.AI's Grok model.

## Methodology

### Data Collection

Images were generated using X.AI's Grok model via the OpenAI Python client. Prompts included diverse artistic scenarios, such as serene landscapes, abstract patterns, and surreal dreamscapes.

### Evaluation Metrics

1. **AHNS Score**: Combines harmony and novelty into a single metric.

   $AHNS = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} (w_h \cdot h_i + w_n \cdot n_i)$

   Where:
   - $N$ is the total number of images evaluated
   - $w_h$ and $w_n$ are weights for harmony and novelty (typically 0.5 each)
   - $h_i$ is the harmony score for image $i$
   - $n_i$ is the novelty score for image $i$

2. **Harmony Score**: Measures color harmony and composition.

   $H = \frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=1}^{M} \min_{s \in S} |h_i - s|$

   Where:
   - $M$ is the number of color harmony rules evaluated
   - $S$ is the set of ideal harmony values
   - $h_i$ represents the current image's harmony value
   - $\min_{s \in S}$ finds the closest ideal harmony value

3. **Novelty Score**: Quantifies uniqueness using embedding distances.

   $N = 1 - \frac{1}{K}\sum_{i=1}^{K} \cos(\theta_i)$

   Where:
   - $K$ is the number of reference images
   - $\theta_i$ is the angle between the current image's embedding and reference image $i$
   - $\cos(\theta_i)$ measures similarity (1 = identical, 0 = completely different)
   - The score is inverted (1 - mean) so higher values indicate more novelty

## Results

### Key Findings

- **AHNS Score**: 0.648 ± 0.112
- **Harmony Score**: 0.336 ± 0.089
- **Novelty Score**: 0.960 ± 0.031

## Discussion

### Strengths

- High novelty scores indicate unique and creative outputs.
- Consistent performance across different prompts.
- Strong correlation between harmony and AHNS scores.

### Areas for Improvement

- Moderate harmony scores suggest room for improvement in color and composition.
- Some variability in AHNS scores across different prompts.

## Conclusion

Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of the AHNS framework in evaluating generative model outputs. The high novelty scores of X.AI's Grok model highlight its potential for creative applications, while moderate harmony scores indicate areas for further refinement.

## Future Work

Future research could explore the impact of different prompts and styles on AHNS scores, as well as the integration of additional aesthetic metrics.
